# Simple Data Analysis with Python and SQL
### Introduction
This is a simple project to show case the usage of Python to manipulate data and show the data in a graph that is stored in RDBMS. The dataset is for SQLite and it comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atanaskanev/sqlite-sakila-sample-database). The dataset is about a fake DVD rental shop.
The analysis here is to understand the following question:
1. Which movies are rented the most?
2. How much revenue is generated by each film?
3. Which users are renting the most?
### Project Structure
The analysis is done in the jupyter-notebook file. There are two files:
1. `film_count_revenue.ipynb` which contains the analysis for most rented film and revenue
2. `customer_rent_analysis.ipynb` which contaisn the analysis for user rental

The SQL queries and connection to the database function are stored in different files. The `sql_function.py` stores the sql connection whilst the `sql_query.py` stores the sql queries which are stored in variables.

### Python Library
Here is the list of Python external libraries that are used in this project:
```
pandas=1.4.2
seaborn=0.11.2
matplotlib=3.5.2
```
For the connection to the SQLite database we use the `sqlite3` library which a Python built-in library.
